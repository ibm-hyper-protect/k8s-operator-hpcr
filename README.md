# Hyper Protect Virtual Servers Kubernetes Operator

[![Controller Package](https://github.com/ibm-hyper-protect/k8s-operator-hpcr/actions/workflows/release-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ibm-hyper-protect/k8s-operator-hpcr/actions/workflows/release-package.yml)

By using the [k8s-operator-hpcr](https://github.com/ibm-hyper-protect/k8s-operator-hpcr) you can implement a solution that manages Hyper Protect Virtual Servers based on a custom resource definition from within your Kubernetes cluster. By using Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, you can run industry-standard, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images within a secure enclave which provides a highly isolated, highly trusted environment for your workloads.

Hyper Protect Virtual Servers are provided by [IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers for VPC (HPVS for VPC)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-se#about-hyper-protect-virtual-servers-for-vpc) in IBM Cloud data centers, or by [IBM Hyper Protect Virtual Servers v2](https://www.ibm.com/products/hyper-protect-virtual-servers) on a IBM Z(R) or LinuxONE system in your own hybrid multicloud environments.

To get started, see [how to setup the controller in your cluster](#installing-the-controller).  Once installed:

- To use the operator to manage IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers for VPC, see [Using-OnCloud.md](Using-OnCloud.md).
- To use the operator to manage IBM Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, see [Using-OnPrem.md](Using-OnPrem.md).

## Limitations

- only support the Default k8s namespace for the moment
- poor error handling in case the VSI startup fails (e.g. because of a wrong encryption key, fixed for onprem)
- all disks for the onprem case are created on the same storage pool
- IBM Hyper Protect Virtual Servers v1 and IBM CloudÂ® Hyper Protect Virtual Servers v1 are not supported.

## Installation & Deployment

Follow the instructions in the [deploy](https://github.com/ibm-hyper-protect/k8s-operator-hpcr/deploy) directory to install the operator on your cluster.
